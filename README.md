# Computer-Graphics-Project
## Project Overview
This C++ project is an exciting space-shooting game built using OpenGL. The objective of the game is to eliminate all the enemies on the screen by shooting at them. The game consists of two levels. The first level serves as a practice round, allowing players to become familiar with the game mechanics, controls, and objectives. The second level, known as the boss level, presents a challenging encounter with a powerful boss character that possesses multiple lives. Players must defeat the boss by strategically shooting at it while evading its attacks. Upon defeating the boss, the game concludes with a spectacular explosion and rewards the player with points. This project showcases modern OpenGL techniques, including realistic physics simulation, while incorporating visually appealing 2D sprites and textures to create an immersive gaming experience.

## How to Run the Project
The 2 files can easily run on Windows, Linux OS. Don't forget to add the header file in your system as it contains all the custom built functions. The Source file named as ```Source.cpp``` imports ```Header.h``` file and uses the functions defined inside it.
